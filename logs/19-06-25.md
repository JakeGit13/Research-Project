## Work Completed

- Defined project scope: integrating audio features into face-vocal tract reconstruction
- Set up GitHub repository
- Downloaded test data and PCA code from [OSF repository](https://osf.io/3m5pr/files/osfstorage)
- Successfully ran Scholes et al. scripts after resolving dependencies
- Cloned USC Speech MRI repository (Lim et al. 2021)
- Researched PCA fundamentals for speech production

## Problems Encountered

- Large .mat video files (~2GB) - added to .gitignore
- Missing MATLAB toolboxes:
    - Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox (for `refline`)
    - Parallel Computing Toolbox (for `gcp`)
- Function `pcaScholesParallel` not found - replaced with `doPCA` (found in all other scripts)
- Output figures differ slightly from paper - need to double check 

## Next Session

- Look through Lim et al. paper methodology for audio-MRI integration
- Design audio processing pipeline with our constraints e.g. 16fps 
- Test pipeline on USC-TIMIT data while waiting for project audio files
	- Start with implementing spectrographs
